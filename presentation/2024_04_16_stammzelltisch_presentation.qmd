## Artificial intelligence 
* trialGPT - an assistance system to foster the design of clinical trials
    * Many clinical studies fail
    * Can we use artificial intelligence (AI) to design more useful clinical trials?
    * Algorithmic study design instead of studies based on "gut feeling"
    * Switch perspective:
        * Today: New patient --> AI chooses the best-fitting (already existing) study
        * Tomorrow: AI proposes new design of a clinical study based on knowing which patients come to the UKD

## Challenges
* How can we formally describe the space of possible studies?
    * Parameter to study (e. g. Hba1c, blood pressure / survival time)
    * Inclusion criteria (e. g. age > 65 / Diabetes Mellitus Type II)
    * Intervention / grouping (e. g. Metformine + diet vs. diet only)
    * Hypotheses (e. g. Hba1c after 3 months in group Metformine + diet lower than in group diet only)
    * â€¦
* How do we quantify the utility of a particular study design?

## Attempt to simplify
* Let large language model (LLM) summarize state of the art based on researchers' prompt
* Let researcher define designs in collaboration with statistician
* Simulate suggested clinical studies and evaluate their usefulness

## LLM to summarize state of the art
* Vanilla LLMs provide somewhat intelligent answers - yet not a comprehensive overview of the state of the art
* Fine-tuning of LLM vs. retrieval augmented-generation (RAG)
    * Fine-tuning: optimize weights of neural net based on new documents
    * RAG: 
        * Generation = what the LLM spits out
        * Augment the output by the knowledge retrieved from submitted documents

## RAG in our case
* Download documents from <https://clinicaltrials.gov/> and [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and feed them into LLM
* What works:
    * Needle in haystack can be retrieved in a nice way
        * e. g. "What shall I do in the case of a blast crisis in a person older than 80 with diabetes?"
* What doesn't work so well:
    * Grand, overarching synopsis of current state of the art

## Little LLM / RAG tutorial

## Conclusion
* LLMs are astonishlingly good at many things
* In my opinion, they are quite a lot under human performance for many complex tasks
* A lot can be done locally
* In my experience: ChatGPT-4 is better than Llama2
